# Project 3 Random Number Guesser

Your task is to code the number guesser game. You should generate a random number and the user has to guess until they guess the number.

To-Do's:

1. Initialize a random number
2. Create a loop which should loop until the number is guessed
3. Ask the user for their guess
4. If the guessed number equals the actual number then print "Hurraaa you won! GUESSED_NUMBER was the corret guess."
5. Else if the guessed number is smaller than the actual number then print "lower"
6. Else print "higher"

Optionally

- You can implement lives so the user has to guess the guess number within given lives
- Give the user the chance to play again if they guessed the correct number

Tip (only look here if your code doesn't work properly)

- Don't overwrite the random number with a new one at each loop
