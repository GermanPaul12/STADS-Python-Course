# import the random library

# create a random number between 0 and 100

# create an infinite loop and ask the user for a guess inside the loop

# we check inside the loop if the guess equals the random number if so we print "Hurraaa you won! {guess} was the corret guess."

#? Add this point you can optionally ask the user if they want to play again if they answer yes then overwrite the random number with a new random number

#? If they don't want to play again or you don't wat to implement the option to play again: break the loop

# else if the guess is smaller than the random number print "lower"

# else print "higher"
